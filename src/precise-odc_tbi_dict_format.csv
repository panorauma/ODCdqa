Instructions,Conditionally Required,"The Instructions is equivalent to the Preferred Question Text and must be included to indicate how the data are collected if you using a form builder. The text does not need to be in the form of a question, but can be, and should be compatible with use of a case report form (CRF), data collection template, questionnaire, or measure. Most preclinical studies will not use a CRF type of collection tool, but Preferred Question Text is required to standardize how the data are collected. Preferred Question Text can be in the form of instructions or guidelines for use.",Preferred_Question_Text;Guidelines;Instructions
CDEClassification,Optional,"Core CDEs are data elements that are vital to the reporting of all preclinical studies and are intended to be a small minimal set of CDEs that are assigned the designation of ""Core"" based on a consensus of best research practices from the literature. Core CDEs collect essential information and can be general as applied to any preclinical data study, regardless of disease, or may be disease-specific; Recommended CDEs are data elements that are essential based on certain conditions or experimental designs to test the outcome in a particular domain and are recorded in most studies. In most cases, Recommended CDEs are well-established experimental factors or outcome measures and are highly recommended for general of disease-specific preclinical studies; Supplemental CDEs are data elements which may be collected but not typically recorded or reported and considered not vital. Supplemental CDEs but may be useful for some preclinical studies, but use depends upon the study design, protocol or type of research involved; Exploratory CDEs are data elements that requires further validation, but may fill current gaps in the CDEs and/or substitute for an existing CDE once validation is complete. They are reasonable to use with the understanding of their limited validation. These are similar to unique data elements (UDE) and upon periodic review demonstrating validation and general consensus among researchers can be elevated to Core, Recommended, or Supplemental",CDE_Classification;CDELevel;CDE_Level;Classification
DataType,Required,"Select the type of data to be collected from the dropdown list: Value List, Text, Number, Date, Time, Datetime, Geolocation, File, URI/URL, thumbnail, Other; If your CDE does not fit any of the above data types, select Other and we will provide assistance.",Data_Type;Data Type;Field_Type;Field Type

Keywords,Optional,"Keywords used for search, query, ontology; include data element aliases; unstructured set of terms or phrases that describe what the CDE is about.

References,Optional,"If there is published evidence on the validity / reliability in target types of studies of a CDE or Bundle / Group / Subgroup, provide the references to validation publication(s). DOIs, PubMed IDs, or other unique stable identifiers are preferred. URLs are acceptable. If the CDE is part of a standardized instrument, or is directly pulled from external guidance, provide at least one Reference. If used among different applications, provide references for both/all.
